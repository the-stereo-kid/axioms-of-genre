# axioms-of-genre
A visulizer (for my opinionated view) of electronic music genres

**Proposal** 

In order to demonstrate my ability to appoach and simplify complexity with a technical solution I will be attempting to answer the following question and provide a demonstration of the solution that can be achieved within a short amount of time.

## Design question: 
**How do we visulaly present a breakdown of electronic music genres?**

- First thoughts
    - define root / first order nodes
        - then come second order (sub) nodes representing meta data within general classification
    - use axioms to narrow the field of view (more to be explained/explored on this below) 
    - use a loosely structured database to allow freedom and organic modeling of relationships
