# axioms-of-genre
A visulizer (for my opinionated view) of electronic music genres

**Proposal** 

In order to demonstrate my ability to appoach and simplify complexity with a technical solution I will be attempting to answer the following question and provide a demonstration of the solution that can be achieved within a short amount of time.

## Design question: 
**How do we visulaly present a breakdown of electronic music genres?**

- First thoughts
    - define root / first order nodes
        - then come second order (sub) nodes representing meta data within general classification
    - use axioms to narrow the field of view (more to be explained/explored on this below) 
    - use a loosely structured database to allow freedom and organic modeling of relationships

## Exploring the defenitions of genre

Lets begin with a few assumptions to cut out a lot of noise.
These are the axioms that we are refering to and will be a basis for the further development of the project. 

### Axioms

**Firstly:** This map of music will only explore electornic music, ie tempo driven music with a consistent beat grid
furthermore
- this will be based on my understanding and appreciation of the music
- it will contain broad sweeping statements in order to categorize (generalize)
- exceptions and observations will be mentioned on a case by case basis
- such as elements that are pointers to categories

**Lastly:** 
for this discussion to be wholistic we must look at how the production environment influences the local music scene and vice-versa +
The evolution of sound through historical influence, weather it be cultural, socio-political or technological.
